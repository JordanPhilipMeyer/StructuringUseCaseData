Most cases, if positive on CT, are heading to the OR, though some patients are treated with antibiotics for early appendicitis. The rapid identification of acute appendicitis can streamline these processes and ensure people get the treatment they need. An algorithm meeting this use case would also help prioritize the case on the worklist.", "Narratives": "A 25-year-old male presents to the emergency room with fever and abdominal pain. The patient has been getting progressively worse over the past few days. Associated lab findings are leukocytosis (elevated white blood cell count) and anorexia.", "Workflow Description": "An image is obtained from the modality and sent to PACS and the AI engine. The image is analyzed by the engine. The system categorizes the status of the appendix as well as whether the appendix is ruptured. A message is sent to PACS from the engine with the classification information. Ancillary data is also sent to the PACS if collected by the engine."}, "Data Elements": {"Execution Conditions": {"Procedure": {"Procedure": "CT, abdomen, pelvis, w/o contrast", "Modality": "CT", "Body Area": "abdomen", "Anatomy": "appendix"}, "Demographic": {"Age": "Patient\u2019s age at the time of registration", "Ethnicity": "Ethnicity of patient, entered as Hispanic, not of Hispanic origin, or unknown.", "Race": "Race of patient, entered as American Indian or Alaskan Native, Asian or Pacific Islander, Black, White, or unknown.", "Sex": "A value representing the sex of a Living subject."}}, "Considerations for Dataset Development": [{"Data Element": "Obstruction", "Data Type": "categorical", "Description": "list of possible obstructions in the around the appendiceal.
